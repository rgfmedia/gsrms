00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,583
A legendary king

Blacksmith?
That is your story?

164
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,590
How did a legendary

last of the Akkadians,

00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:21,465
become a blacksmith?

167
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:25,903
Civilization became
too uncivilized for me.

168
00:18:27,304 --> 00:18:29,507
I have searched for you
for a long time.

169
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:34,100
Your name inspires.

170
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,311
It is a rallying cry.

171
00:18:36,313 --> 00:18:39,281
My people need a hero
to bring peace,

172
00:18:39,283 --> 00:18:40,484
a warrior hero.

173
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,490
Like I said...
you got the wrong guy.

174
00:18:46,757 --> 00:18:50,992
My father was Balthazar,
King of Nubia.

175
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:51,897
Balthazar?

176
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:54,933
He lived well...

177
00:18:56,434 --> 00:18:57,703
but not long enough.

178
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:00,739
Sorry he's gone.

179
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:06,474
My father told me that you
two had a great bond,

180
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:08,877
that if Nubia
ever needed an ally,

181
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:12,130
the Scorpion King would ride
from the east with his armies

182
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,918
and fight with us.

183
00:19:15,552 --> 00:19:16,819
I have no army.

184
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,890
You have your strength,
and you have me.

185
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:23,794
A princess?

00:19:24,462 --> 00:19:25,664
A warrior.

187
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,765
Do you know Nebserek,
the War Lord,

188
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:33,469
sweeps across Egypt
with his hordes

189
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:35,538
enslaving, burning?

190
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,907
He wields a cursed sword,
the Fang of Anubis.

191
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:41,810
No one can stand against
him while he possesses it.

192
00:19:41,812 --> 00:19:46,140
But legend tells of a way
to defeat the sword.

193
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,818
The secret is contained
in the <i>Book of Souls.</i>

194
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,556
It is a hidden text,
and I know where to find it.

195
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:55,424
Sounds like a bedtime story.

196
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:59,431
Nebserek marches on Nubia,
on my people.

197
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:02,964
With the <i>Book of Souls,</i>
we can stop him.

198
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:04,200
You're on a quest?

199
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,971
Yes.

200
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,400
Good luck.

201
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:10,942
You are coming with me!

202
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,676
I don't quest.

203
00:20:14,678 --> 00:20:16,511
Why?

204
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:19,749
They're always a thousand times
more difficult than you think,

205
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,653
and someone
won't make it back alive.

206
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:31,126
The jackal...
is Nebserek's symbol.

207
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:33,462
We share the same enemy.

208
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:36,300
Help me find
the <i>Book of Souls,</i>

209
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,503
and I will help you
kill the owner of the dagger.

210
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:44,509
I'll take both.

211
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:46,544
No!

212
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:52,748
You were born a warrior.

213
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,552
It is your fate to fight
for those less fortunate souls.

214
00:20:57,554 --> 00:21:01,759
Stand or fall,
I will fight by your side.

215
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:06,831
I implore you,
remember who you are.

216
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:13,638
[bird squawks]

217
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:34,557
[woman] <i>This man you
seek, the Scorpion King,</i>

218
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,661
<i>travels with a Nubian.</i>

219
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,799
[chirping]

220
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,632
<i>And they are close.</i>

221
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:44,867
Close to what?

222
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:46,635
Legend tells
of a gateway

223
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:48,870
in the Valley
of the 13th Moon,

224
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:51,706
where it is said
the <i>Book of Souls</i> rests,

225
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,943
hidden away
from all mankind.

226
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:57,946
He who possesses
the <i>Book of Souls</i>

227
00:21:57,948 --> 00:22:00,950
has the power to destroy
the Fang of Anubis.

228
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:04,720
These sands have been searched
by many hands for many years.

229
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:08,960
Searched, yes, but not
by the Scorpion King.

230
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,620
[squawking]

231
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:20,138
[squawking]

232
00:22:37,554 --> 00:22:38,654
[Mathayus]
We should go around.

233
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:41,857
The Valley of the 13th Moon
is a half day's ride away.

234
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:43,858
Going around
is a day out of our way.

235
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,694
- You don't wanna go in there.
- I must.

236
00:22:46,696 --> 00:22:49,298
- We can't be late.
- Late for what?

237
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,100
The final day
of this lunar cycle.

238
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,801
The moon can wait.

239
00:22:52,803 --> 00:22:55,172
I've waited 36 moons
for this rising.

240
00:22:57,574 --> 00:23:00,770
Ha! Ha!

241
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:19,928
Why are we stopping here,
blacksmith?

242
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,964
[whinnies]

243
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:25,330
- Put your weapons down.
- There's nobody here.

244
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,770
Yes, there is.
Drop your weapons, now.

245
00:23:27,772 --> 00:23:29,907
Forgive her!
She can't see!

246
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,430
Who are you talking to?

247
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,888
The Black Arrows.

248
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,127
They weren't trying to hit us.
If they were, we'd be dead.

249
00:24:23,293 --> 00:24:25,994
[chuckling]

250
00:24:25,996 --> 00:24:30,670
[tribe chattering, singing]

251
00:24:42,112 --> 00:24:44,215
Told you
we should've gone around.

252
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,985
You trespass on
our sacred lands,

253
00:24:50,987 --> 00:24:53,757
and for this you must die.

254
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:55,390
We meant no insult.

255
00:24:55,392 --> 00:24:58,270
The territory is marked.

256
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,298
You chose to ignore
the warning.

257
00:25:01,998 --> 00:25:05,670
How did woman,
very beautiful woman,

258
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,336
fall in with hard man
like this, hmm?

259
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:09,700
Tell me, hmm?

260
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,440
He's my father's blacksmith.

261
00:25:11,442 --> 00:25:14,342
A blacksmith
and a breeder.

262
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:16,145
[all laughing]

263
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,148
He likes you.

264
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:21,817
Can you cook? Cook?
Can you cook? Hmm?

265
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:23,821
I'm a Nubian warrior...

266
00:25:24,821 --> 00:25:26,888
Yes, I can cook.

267
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,424
I will give you
two wild pigs

268
00:25:29,426 --> 00:25:33,328
and five amphoras of
pomegranate wine for her. Huh?

269
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,898
- Yeah?
- Five wild pigs and ten amphoras.

270
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,902
Oh, no, no, no!

271
00:25:39,904 --> 00:25:42,370
I thought you were
going to kill him.

272
00:25:42,372 --> 00:25:44,720
Oh, I am.

273
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,107
[laughs]

274
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:52,114
But after I do, I will
take you for my own, hmm?

275
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:54,415
Feed him to the wastelands.

276
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:58,886
We will drink to his death
with my wine, huh? Huh? No?

277
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:02,790
I'm not for sale.
And I'm not a breeder.

278
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:04,460
[chieftain laughing]

279
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:05,493
Uruk!

280
00:26:05,495 --> 00:26:09,833
[speaking in foreign language]

281
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,843
[continues
in foreign language]

282
00:26:21,177 --> 00:26:24,148
The Shaman says you are
from the Land of the East.

283
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:29,186
The Scorpion King
is what you are called, eh?

284
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:31,886
Just a blacksmith.

285
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:33,355
Aye, this is what I said.

286
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:36,961
That you are very small
to be such legendary warrior.

287
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:39,494
So how do you want it?

288
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:42,830
I can split your skulls
with an ax

289
00:26:42,832 --> 00:26:44,332
and stick them on a spike.

290
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:46,868
You can burn on a pyre.

291
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,805
Or I can lash you
to a stump

292
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:52,176
and let the vultures
and insects have you.

293
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,978
What is your name,
warrior?

294
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,882
I am Uruk, son of Kali,
leader of the Black Arrows

295
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,886
and People of the Sand.

296
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,323
Chieftain Uruk...

297
00:27:10,394 --> 00:27:12,860
your people are hunters,
are they not?

298
00:27:12,862 --> 00:27:14,128
Mmm.

299
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,900
So give me the same chance
to live as any beast.

300
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:21,136
You are not a beast.
You are a man.

301
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:22,838
Yes.

302
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,240
I bleed red like you.

303
00:27:25,242 --> 00:27:28,409
And like you, I'd rather die
on my feet than my knees.

304
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:33,160
I will only send four men
to kill you.

305
00:27:33,516 --> 00:27:36,180
Better make it five.

306
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,289
When this hunt is done,
and I'm still alive,

307
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,894
you let me keep the girl
and we ride free.

308
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:48,967
Agreed.

309
00:27:53,503 --> 00:27:56,107
[horn bellows]

310
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,180
[men shouting]

311
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,451
What did I tell you
about quests?

312
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:29,941
When you reach that
arrow, we will hunt you.

313
00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:35,978
Run fast, blacksmith,
or your death will be slow.

314
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,549
[chuckling]

315
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,238
[chieftain] Run!

316
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:25,463
[men shouting]

317
00:29:51,688 --> 00:29:54,425
[thunder rumbling]

318
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,410
Ah!

319
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:05,362
[thunder rumbling]

320
00:31:24,447 --> 00:31:25,649
Uruk!

321
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:42,798
[groans]

322
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,532
Drop it!

323
00:31:44,534 --> 00:31:46,470
Drop it!

324
00:31:54,144 --> 00:31:56,411
You are a worthy adversary,
Akkadian.

325
00:31:56,413 --> 00:31:59,548
You could have killed me
and my men,

326
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,117
as we would have surely killed you, hmm?
[chuckles]

327
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,454
But you chose mercy.

328
00:32:06,456 --> 00:32:10,360
There will be no mercy for those
who have not shown mercy.

329
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:17,465
Five pigs and some wine?

330
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:19,436
That's all I fetch
in your simple mind?

331
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,640
You've never tasted
pomegranate wine.

332
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:26,643
[horse whinnies]

333
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:29,379
- Ha!
- Hyah!

334
00:32:30,246 --> 00:32:32,749
[squawks]

335
00:32:34,184 --> 00:32:37,187
[men shouting]

336
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:55,403
There it is,
the Valley of the 13th Moon.

337
00:32:55,405 --> 00:32:57,438
[Mathayus] Tell me about
the <i>Book of Souls.</i>

338
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,875
It is said to be guarded
by the Temple of Scrolls.

339
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:04,212
It can only be entered
on the eve of the Blue Moon.

340
00:33:04,214 --> 00:33:06,348
Once every three years
on the lunar cycle.

341
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,584
That is tonight.

342
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:10,351
How do you know all this?

343
00:33:10,353 --> 00:33:12,354
My family has been
the guardian of this book

344
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:14,755
since before the Pharaohs,

345
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:17,494
passing it down
from generation to generation.

346
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,395
No one's been there
or seen this book

347
00:33:20,397 --> 00:33:22,833
because they've never
needed it until now.

348
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,634
Before he passed,

349
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,235
my father entrusted me
with this guardianship.

350
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:29,637
As fate would have it,

351
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:32,206
he didn't have time
to tell me much about the book.

352
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:33,875
And you're sure
it's down there?

353
00:33:33,877 --> 00:33:35,812
The prophecy says it is.

354
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:40,648
So, we're just going to ride down
there, walk through front the door,

355
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,783
and they're going to
give you this book?

356
00:33:42,785 --> 00:33:45,252
It's not exactly a door.

357
00:33:45,254 --> 00:33:46,623
It's more of a gateway.

358
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,980
[Mathayus] Doesn't look like
a Temple of Scrolls to me.

359
00:34:45,982 --> 00:34:48,416
[Tala]
It's in ancient writing.

360
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:49,921
"The one that
repeats its form."

361
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:52,987
Sumerian.

362
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:55,724
Not so different than the
language I learned as a boy.

363
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:59,326
[Tala] The moon repeats
its form every 30 days.

364
00:34:59,328 --> 00:35:00,795
The Blue Moon repeats its form

365
00:35:00,797 --> 00:35:03,297
every three years
after the summer solstice.

366
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:04,734
We've found it.

367
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:13,677
We found a stone gateway
in the middle of nowhere...

368
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:17,811
leading to nothing.

369
00:35:17,813 --> 00:35:20,415
We must hurry,
it's almost nightfall.

370
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:21,752
We can't miss the moonrise.

371
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:28,355
What does your scroll say?

372
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:30,391
"After you pass
the moonstone threshold,

373
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:33,730
take four hundred paces
just east of north."

374
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,502
This way!

375
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:05,862
What now?

376
00:36:07,596 --> 00:36:09,866
Don't rush me. It's my
first time doing this.

377
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:24,815
Moon's rising.

378
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,564
Let's do this, blacksmith.

379
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,900
The lenses must align
with a cipher.

380
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,378
A combination.

381
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,716
- What is it?
- I'm looking.

382
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:07,958
"The one
that repeats its form."

383
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,593
That's the cipher!

384
00:37:11,895 --> 00:37:13,594
"The one that repeats
its form."

385
00:37:13,596 --> 00:37:15,965
That's what's written
on the gateway.

386
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:02,679
Let's go.
It won't stay open for long.

387
00:38:21,197 --> 00:38:23,530
What is that?

388
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:24,632
Quicksilver.

389
00:38:24,634 --> 00:38:26,103
Nature's guard against evil.

390
00:39:11,214 --> 00:39:12,850
I hate quests.

391
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:33,871
Blacksmith.
This way.

392
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,922
Tell me you know what this
magic book looks like.

393
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:31,695
It could be a scroll on vellum,
written in codex form...

394
00:40:32,795 --> 00:40:33,931
perhaps a tome.

395
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,933
Maybe a papyrus book
scribbled in burnt bones.

396
00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:42,936
So, you're saying
you have no idea, right?

397
00:40:42,938 --> 00:40:45,808
Yes, that is
what I'm saying.

398
00:41:05,661 --> 00:41:06,897
[growling]

399
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:20,770
Kill intruder!

400
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:22,744
Ah!

401
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,378
Ouch!

402
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,490
No fair!

403
00:41:27,116 --> 00:41:28,851
Ah!

404
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:35,758
[groaning]

405
00:41:39,696 --> 00:41:41,264
[woman] Enkidu! Enough!

406
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:15,290
These people opened the
portal with a lunar scroll.

407
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:18,833
- They are not our foe.
- They are armed!

408
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:21,170
One of them attacked me
unfairly from behind.

409
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:25,241
I am sure
they meant no harm.

410
00:42:28,377 --> 00:42:33,249
I am Tala, daughter of
Balthazar, warrior of Nubia.

411
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,253
We have come
for the <i>Book of Souls.</i>

412
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:39,156
Have you?

413
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:56,500
And you've brought a brute?

414
00:42:57,373 --> 00:42:58,409
A barbarian?

415
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:06,830
You're Akkadian.

416
00:43:09,918 --> 00:43:11,180
What is that thing?

417
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,121
[growls]
I'm not a thing!

418
00:43:14,123 --> 00:43:16,292
- A golem.
- Stupid human!

419
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:22,960
Enkidu is formed from clay,
brought to life by magic.

420
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,532
My father made him
to be my protector.

421
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:26,403
I have the strength
of ten men.

422
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,977
Maybe 20. [growls]

423
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,784
[laughs]

424
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:47,230
I bet you wouldn't sell her for five
pigs and some pomegranate wine.

425
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:50,126
Barbarian.

426
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:03,272
[chuckling]
Pretty human.

427
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:29,329
So you've come
for the <i>Book of Souls?</i>

428
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:31,969
[Tala] Yes.
My people are in peril.

429
00:44:32,902 --> 00:44:34,302
We need it
to vanquish a warlord

430
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:37,270
who leads his army
across Egypt.

431
00:44:37,272 --> 00:44:41,477
He carries a cursed sword.
None can stand against it.

432
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,790
I have nothing on how
to defeat a cursed sword.

433
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,284
But the legend says
the book is here.

434
00:44:49,552 --> 00:44:51,485
You must help us.

435
00:44:51,487 --> 00:44:52,923
We are running out of time.

436
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:55,590
I'm sorry.

437
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:57,127
There is nothing here
for you.

438
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:01,130
The book is here.

439
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:05,866
I have many scrolls,
Akkadian.

440
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:10,360
Some codices...
some tomes.

441
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,209
I have read them all,
committed them to memory...

442
00:45:14,877 --> 00:45:17,800
but I have not a single book.

443
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:24,221
Tala, what does your scroll
say about this <i>Book of Souls?</i>

444
00:45:27,623 --> 00:45:30,257
The scroll says,

445
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:33,360
"The <i>Book of Souls</i> is written
on vellum of alabaster.

446
00:45:33,362 --> 00:45:36,963
The body of its forbidden
text is uncovered

447
00:45:36,965 --> 00:45:38,534
in the blue light
of the moon."

448
00:45:56,185 --> 00:45:59,255
"Vellum of alabaster.

449
00:46:02,324 --> 00:46:06,126
The body of its forbidden text
is uncovered

450
00:46:06,128 --> 00:46:09,563
only in the blue light
of the moon."

451
00:46:09,565 --> 00:46:12,333
- [roars]
- Enkidu!

452
00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:13,503
No.

453
00:46:19,641 --> 00:46:23,145
It's... you.

454
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:57,179
[Tala]
You are the <i>Book of Souls.</i>

455
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,323
The moonlight reveals
the text?

456
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,127
Yes.

457
00:47:12,427 --> 00:47:14,594
It is revealed
on the third moon

458
00:47:14,596 --> 00:47:17,264
in a season of four moons.

459
00:47:17,266 --> 00:47:20,700
Seven times
in the 19-year Metonic cycle.

460
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,472
What's written here?

461
00:47:23,772 --> 00:47:27,775
Names of souls
taken by a sword forced

462
00:47:27,777 --> 00:47:30,210
in the Underworld
by Anubis.

463
00:47:30,212 --> 00:47:34,315
- Do you know who they are?
- Yes.

464
00:47:34,317 --> 00:47:38,351
With every soul
the sword takes,

465
00:47:38,353 --> 00:47:42,558
I can hear their screams,
see their faces.

466
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:50,367
Some fates
are worse than death.

467
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,677
[bird squawking]

468
00:48:07,482 --> 00:48:09,652
[men shouting]

469
00:48:19,561 --> 00:48:22,632
[shouting continues]

470
00:48:41,183 --> 00:48:43,419
[horse whinnies]

471
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:49,625
I have no quarrel with you,
Chieftain Uruk.

472
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,259
I seek the <i>Book of Souls</i>

473
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:53,626
in the Valley
of the 13th Moon.

474
00:48:53,628 --> 00:48:58,431
Your jackal bellies
are never full, are they?

475
00:48:58,433 --> 00:49:01,434
Whatever the Akkadian
paid for passage,

476
00:49:01,436 --> 00:49:04,404
King Nebserek
will triple it.

477
00:49:04,406 --> 00:49:05,139
Mm.

478
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:08,708
He paid with courage
and respect.

479
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:12,246
Give us passage,
and you will be spared.

480
00:49:12,248 --> 00:49:15,318
Stand your ground,
and I will crush you!

481
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:25,726
We are People of the Sand.

482
00:49:25,728 --> 00:49:28,395
Sand cannot be crushed.

483
00:49:28,397 --> 00:49:31,333
It can only change its form.

484
00:49:32,201 --> 00:49:33,867
[man shouts]

485
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:36,705
[men shouting]

486
00:49:47,215 --> 00:49:49,550
You're going to pay for that.

487
00:49:49,552 --> 00:49:51,886
That was my favorite table.

488
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:54,221
That was my only table.

489
00:49:54,223 --> 00:49:55,688
You shouldn't have
broke it then.

490
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:57,458
Puny human.

491
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,494
My father
was a great Sumerian mage.

492
00:50:00,496 --> 00:50:03,197
He brought me here
before I could even walk.

493
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:05,632
He told me very little
about my curse.

494
00:50:05,634 --> 00:50:08,402
You have no idea how
to defeat this curse?

495
00:50:08,404 --> 00:50:11,505
The sword was found
in King Memtep's tomb

496
00:50:11,507 --> 00:50:13,407
beneath a city
called Amonesh.

497
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:16,376
Your quest
must take you there.

498
00:50:16,378 --> 00:50:20,250
The secret lies within
King Memtep's tomb.

499
00:50:23,386 --> 00:50:24,621
All right then.

500
00:50:26,422 --> 00:50:29,458
We will go to Amonesh
and break this curse.

501
00:50:30,525 --> 00:50:34,730
First command!
Keep Amina here forever.

502
00:50:45,808 --> 00:50:47,775
I hate this puny human.

503
00:50:47,777 --> 00:50:50,911
There's a trade route that
leads to the city of Aqaba.

504
00:50:50,913 --> 00:50:52,545
There is a port here.

505
00:50:52,547 --> 00:50:55,683
You can hire a boat to
cross the sea to Amonesh.

506
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,353
Amina likes him.

507
00:50:57,819 --> 00:50:59,286
This life...

508
00:50:59,288 --> 00:51:00,891
- [Enkidu] He's ugly.
- ...must be hard to bear.

509
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,427
I have escaped the pain
of the living.

510
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:07,663
And the joy?

511
00:51:08,831 --> 00:51:10,300
Yes.

512
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:13,335
It is more a burden
than a blessing.

513
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,904
He's got muscles,
but I fight...

514
00:51:17,906 --> 00:51:19,708
Come with us
into the world.

515
00:51:20,976 --> 00:51:22,509
There is nothing more
I would love

516
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:25,445
than to see your world
through my own eyes.

517
00:51:25,447 --> 00:51:27,583
A man of puny flesh.

518
00:51:29,552 --> 00:51:31,588
But I'm afraid
that's not possible.

519
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,590
And if I can make it possible?

520
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,628
He's got muscles,
but I fight muscles...

521
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:41,829
[Tala] I think
I found a shorter...

522
00:51:41,831 --> 00:51:43,931
No fire! No fire!

523
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:46,467
- Put it out! Put it out!
- No fire! No fire!

524
00:51:46,469 --> 00:51:47,867
- It's gone.
- [panting]

525
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:50,536
Enkidu, don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.

526
00:51:50,538 --> 00:51:52,438
- Fire's gone?
- Yes.

527
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,806
I forgot to tell them.

528
00:51:53,808 --> 00:51:55,409
And I'm still here?

529
00:51:55,411 --> 00:51:56,713
Calm yourself,
Enkidu.

530
00:52:00,915 --> 00:52:02,416
[gasps] I hate fire.

531
00:52:02,418 --> 00:52:04,918
Enkidu cannot abide fire.

532
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,454
- I hate fire...
- Not even the smallest of flames.

533
00:52:07,456 --> 00:52:08,725
[Enkidu] I hate it.

534
00:52:11,326 --> 00:52:12,692
[Enkidu roaring]

535
00:52:12,694 --> 00:52:14,695
It's okay.

536
00:52:14,697 --> 00:52:15,865
[roars]

537
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,969
[Enkidu] Stupid humans!

538
00:52:21,369 --> 00:52:23,505
[bird cries]

539
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:29,409
[chirping]

540
00:52:29,411 --> 00:52:31,344
They are too
far ahead of us.

541
00:52:31,346 --> 00:52:32,715
We need to split up.

542
00:52:34,382 --> 00:52:36,382
There's only two ways
out of that valley.

543
00:52:36,384 --> 00:52:38,619
And we'll shut them both off.

544
00:52:38,621 --> 00:52:40,721
Ride the Silk Road
to where the dunes meet the sea.

545
00:52:40,723 --> 00:52:42,422
We have been riding
all the night.

546
00:52:42,424 --> 00:52:44,824
The men, the horses,
they need rest.

547
00:52:44,826 --> 00:52:48,695
You will ride until the horses'
hearts stop beating in their chests.

548
00:52:48,697 --> 00:52:52,699
And then you will go on
foot, crawling if you must,

549
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:55,537
until I get
what I came for.

550
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:57,871
[whistles]

551
00:52:57,873 --> 00:52:59,720

[warriors yelling]

553
00:53:08,851 --> 00:53:09,983
Enkidu?

554
00:53:09,985 --> 00:53:13,456
What do you want, barbarian?

555
00:53:14,389 --> 00:53:15,558
To show you something.

556
00:53:20,862 --> 00:53:23,433
I've seen this tunnel
many times.

557
00:53:25,534 --> 00:53:28,434
I don't like this tunnel.
I've never liked tunnels.

558
00:53:28,436 --> 00:53:30,871
It's dark.
I don't like the dark.

559
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:32,405
[roaring]

560
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:36,578
No fire! No fire!
Amina! Amina!

561
00:53:37,545 --> 00:53:39,846
Amina!
[roaring]

562
00:53:39,848 --> 00:53:43,830
Amina! We must go!
It won't last long.

563
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:44,985
[Enkidu] Amina!

564
00:53:44,987 --> 00:53:47,454
Amina! Don't leave!

565
00:53:47,456 --> 00:53:50,523
Don't go!
[roaring]

566
00:53:50,525 --> 00:53:51,891
[warriors shouting]

567
00:53:51,893 --> 00:53:53,427
Hyah!

568
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:56,320
[horses whinnying]

569
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:12,470
[thunder rumbling]

570
00:54:26,194 --> 00:54:28,630
[horses whinnying]

571
00:54:32,601 --> 00:54:33,636
Let's ride!

572
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:50,900
The horses are rested
and we need to keep moving.

573
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:50,979
One more minute?

574
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:54,650
The sea is beautiful.

575
00:55:56,518 --> 00:55:59,955
I can hear the voices
whispering from ancient shores.

576
00:56:02,824 --> 00:56:04,761
I can taste the salt.

577
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:09,165
I hope Enkidu will be
all right without me.

578
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:12,869
We've never been apart.

579
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:18,173
How does such a creature
have a mortal fear of fire?

580
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,900
Enkidu is clay.

581
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,681
The manifestation of fire
can turn him to stone.

582
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:36,893
You're an unexpected
surprise, Akkadian.

583
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,290
As are you... Amina.

584
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,116
- [distant shouting]
- [horses whinnying]

585
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:14,163
Hyah! Hyah!

586
00:57:14,929 --> 00:57:16,697
[man] Stop the Akkadian!

587
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,670
[whinnies]

588
00:57:23,806 --> 00:57:25,105
I'll take the two
on the right.

589
00:57:25,107 --> 00:57:27,306
That leaves me
the seven on the left.

590
00:57:27,308 --> 00:57:28,608
[Tala] Exactly.

591
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:32,212
You have a book
my master desires!

592
00:57:32,214 --> 00:57:34,140
I don't read books!

593
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,817
Give it to me, Akkadian,
and I give you my word...

594
00:57:37,819 --> 00:57:39,886
I will not leave you
butchered and cleaved.

595
00:57:39,888 --> 00:57:44,291
I will give you a death
worthy of a Scorpion King!

596
00:57:44,293 --> 00:57:47,263
I've turned down that same
offer many times before.

597
00:57:49,831 --> 00:57:51,732
But you are one!

598
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:53,168
We are many!

599
00:57:54,168 --> 00:57:55,237
We are two.

600
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:58,273
The woman?

601
00:58:00,141 --> 00:58:02,875
[laughing]

602
00:58:02,877 --> 00:58:06,913
- The woman! The woman!
- [men laughing]

603
00:58:06,915 --> 00:58:10,500
All right. I'll take
the three on the right.

604
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,120
Fair enough.

605
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:12,889
Ya!

606
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,766
[all shouting]

607
00:58:28,936 --> 00:58:31,139

[grunting]

610
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:23,860
Tala! Get Amina outta here!

611
00:59:25,226 --> 00:59:26,393
[screaming]

612
00:59:26,395 --> 00:59:29,165
[Enkidu] Amina! Amina!

[grunting continues]

615
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:43,946

[roars]

617
00:59:55,223 --> 00:59:57,920
Ah! Ah!

618
01:00:01,496 --> 01:00:03,299
I'm gonna smash ya!

619
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:10,305
[groaning]

620
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:13,976
Well done...

621
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,378
Scorpion King!
[gasps]

[whinnying]

624
01:00:23,485 --> 01:00:24,987
Enkidu! No!

625
01:00:26,154 --> 01:00:28,423
They're just horses.
We don't hurt them.

626
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,994
That Akkadian,
he stole you.

627
01:00:34,996 --> 01:00:37,831
No one stole me.
I left.

628
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:39,800
You only have
two commands now.

629
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,569
Protect me,
and obey me.

630
01:00:42,571 --> 01:00:44,273
Not like that in your books.

631
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,875
Is it?

632
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:48,878
[Enkidu roars]

633
01:00:50,946 --> 01:00:52,415
I don't like him.

634
01:01:42,998 --> 01:01:46,299
Aqaba. A city.
So many people.

635
01:01:46,301 --> 01:01:48,500
How do we hire a boat
to cross the sea?

636
01:01:48,502 --> 01:01:50,305
We sell the horses.

637
01:01:56,612 --> 01:02:01,470
[crowd chattering]

638
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:03,850

[chattering continues]

641
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:42,221
Don't talk to anyone.

642
01:02:42,223 --> 01:02:44,224
We're not here
to trade in gossip.

643
01:02:44,226 --> 01:02:46,358
I will not speak
to these strange people

644
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,262
because I do not know them
and I have nothing to say.

645
01:02:49,264 --> 01:02:51,665
You! Don't talk at all!

646
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,170
[growls]
I like to talk.

648
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,154

- You filthy creature!

[grunts]

652
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:34,310
Sell the horses. Get to the port, hire
a boat, cross the sea to Amonesh.

653
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:36,612
I'll meet you at the tomb.

01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:28,395
Been looking for you.

I'll meet you at the port.

The King of Nubia,
he is your brother?

703
01:08:47,821 --> 01:08:50,523
Yes. Tarqa.

704
01:08:50,525 --> 01:08:54,495
Son of Balthazar,
the King Warrior?

705
01:08:57,598 --> 01:09:01,869
He died, fighting for his
people with honor and dignity.

706
01:09:19,687 --> 01:09:21,757
Let me carry
this burden for you,

707

for you have much
to accomplish on this quest.

708

I am the sole heir
of Nubia, Blacksmith.

709

I am a queen
with no kingdom.

710

Now I know your pain.

01:10:00,562 --> 01:10:01,930
I am sorry for your loss.

712

But your choice
is a simple one.

713
01:10:07,968 --> 01:10:10,972
You can fight on, avenge your
brother and your people.

714
01:10:11,972 --> 01:10:13,441
And maybe you will die.

715
01:10:14,942 --> 01:10:16,110
Or you can turn back now.

716
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:19,140
Make a new life for yourself.

717
01:10:21,715 --> 01:10:25,585
But when you leave this world,
many years from now,

718
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:27,589
and give a full account
of your life here...

719
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:32,593
what story would you like
history to remember?

720
01:10:39,433 --> 01:10:41,503
This is what you
meant about quests?

721
01:11:29,984 --> 01:11:32,217
[Amina] So, you're the
famous Scorpion King?

722
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:34,686
Someone I used to be.

723
01:11:34,688 --> 01:11:37,659
But someday you may regain
your kingdom, build it anew.

724
01:11:38,759 --> 01:11:40,661
There's nothing left
in my kingdom.

725
01:11:42,129 --> 01:11:45,198
In Aqaba, you saw somebody
you wanted to kill.

726
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,903
And in killing that person,
you'd have likely been killed.

727
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:50,505
Yes.

728
01:11:51,705 --> 01:11:53,674
She killed someone
very close to me.

729
01:11:54,709 --> 01:11:56,678
There are many stories
about vengeance.

730
01:11:58,545 --> 01:12:00,682
There is honor
in payback.

731
01:12:05,186 --> 01:12:09,900
[bird twittering]

732
01:12:13,628 --> 01:12:15,831
The Lost City of Amonesh.

733
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:19,167
[bird squawks]

734
01:12:36,851 --> 01:12:39,818
Enkidu, you will have
to wait for us here.

735
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:43,723
I cannot protect you
if I'm not with you.

736
01:12:43,725 --> 01:12:46,930
And I cannot obey you
if I cannot hear you.

737
01:12:47,762 --> 01:12:50,632
- But we'll have torches in there.
- No flames!

738
01:12:51,732 --> 01:12:53,966
But there's no other way.

739
01:12:53,968 --> 01:12:58,720
I may have another way.
But you'll have to trust me.

740
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:24,310
[Enkidu]
A tomb. I hate tombs. Ah.

741
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:31,903
Don't let the fire touch me!
Is the fire touching me?

742
01:13:31,905 --> 01:13:34,105
No, it's not touching you.

743
01:13:34,107 --> 01:13:35,741
[sighs] Yeah.

744
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,777
Come, Enkidu.

745
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:41,782
[panting, trembling]

746
01:13:43,785 --> 01:13:46,985
[groaning]
No fire! No fire!

747
01:13:46,987 --> 01:13:50,880
Amina! Amina!
Don't make me.

748
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:51,724
Stop, it's okay.

749
01:13:51,726 --> 01:13:53,910
[gasping]

750
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:54,327
It's okay.

751
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:55,664
[sighs]

752
01:14:04,871 --> 01:14:06,674
[Amina]
"King Memtep."

753
01:14:08,209 --> 01:14:11,770
This inscription's
just details of his life.

754
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:14,814
The tomb builders would have
never carved the secret text

755
01:14:14,816 --> 01:14:16,716
on how to break
the Curse of Anubis

756
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:20,220
on the walls for robbers
to easily decipher.

757
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:22,954
It would have
been hidden,

758
01:14:22,956 --> 01:14:25,826
or concealed
in the funerary artifacts.

759
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,163
In the sarcophagus?

760
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:33,299
No. That's where
the sword was found.

761
01:14:33,301 --> 01:14:34,966
It would have been separated.

762
01:14:34,968 --> 01:14:36,971
Everything's been
plundered and robbed.

763
01:14:41,142 --> 01:14:42,110
The Sphinx.

764
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:47,282
An idol full of secrets
and mystery.

765
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:53,385
The guardian
of knowledge.

766
01:14:53,387 --> 01:14:55,860
[Amina] The Sphinx
dies for truth.

767
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:58,224
But this is
an androsphinx,

768
01:14:58,226 --> 01:15:02,864
the male of the species, known
as the messenger of truth.

769
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:06,868
Break it open.

770
01:15:17,178 --> 01:15:19,147
- [grunting]
- I'll give it right back.

771
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:23,849
- [grunts]
- Okay, I'll bring it back. I promise.

772
01:15:23,851 --> 01:15:25,120
Bring it back!

773
01:16:08,396 --> 01:16:11,133
- It's a history written in Sumerian.
- Yes.

774
01:16:12,266 --> 01:16:14,100
[Amina] These hieroglyphs
say King Memtep

775
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:16,368
was beset by enemies
on all sides.

776
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:19,300
He called out to the God
of the Underworld,

777
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,600
who forged a sword to steal
the souls of his enemies,

778
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,944
giving King Memtep strength
and power beyond measure.

779
01:16:25,946 --> 01:16:28,247
And the King grew terrible
in his might,

780
01:16:28,249 --> 01:16:33,853
for he was cursed and tormented by
the screams of the tortured souls.

781
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:35,954
King Memtep
returned to Amonesh

782
01:16:35,956 --> 01:16:39,457
to find his royal concubine
had birthed a girl child.

783
01:16:39,459 --> 01:16:44,280
His daughter's skin bore the names
of those slain by the sword.

784
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,533
Anubis told King Memtep
the only way to end the curse

785
01:16:47,535 --> 01:16:49,502
was to destroy the <i>Book
of Souls</i> with the sword.

786
01:16:49,504 --> 01:16:51,200
[creature groaning]

787
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,338
It was the gods' cruel trick
that to save himself,

788
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:57,109
the king must end the curse
by killing his only daughter.

789
01:16:57,111 --> 01:17:00,450
But a powerful mage
saved the girl,

790
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:02,280
stealing her away forever.

791
01:17:02,282 --> 01:17:05,818
And King Memtep went mad
from the curse,

792
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:09,154
driving the sword
into his own heart.

793
01:17:09,156 --> 01:17:12,226
So entering his own name
into the <i>Book of Souls.</i>

794
01:17:16,864 --> 01:17:19,532
[voices murmuring, indistinct]

795
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:22,300
King Memtep was your father?

796
01:17:25,239 --> 01:17:28,375
The mage I thought was my
father raised me as his own.

797
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,411
He meant to protect me.

798
01:17:32,413 --> 01:17:35,980
That's impossible.
That would make you...

799
01:17:35,982 --> 01:17:37,351
I have lived for centuries.

800
01:17:39,419 --> 01:17:42,223
And I will live
for countless millennia more.

801
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:47,896
The only way to break
the Curse of Anubis is to...

802
01:17:49,597 --> 01:17:51,398
I must be destroyed
by the sword.

803
01:17:53,334 --> 01:17:55,403
The <i>Book of Souls</i>
must be destroyed...

804
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:58,380
and the souls freed.

805
01:18:00,907 --> 01:18:04,143
And I am the <i>Book of Souls.</i>

806
01:18:04,145 --> 01:18:08,383
<i>The Book of Souls,</i> hidden in
the body of a beautiful woman.

807
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:18,260
[groans]

808
01:18:26,467 --> 01:18:27,402
[gasping]

809
01:18:30,204 --> 01:18:34,750
Men are simple, aren't they?

810
01:18:45,585 --> 01:18:47,880
[grunts]

811
01:18:48,655 --> 01:18:49,957
[horses whinnying]

812
01:19:05,472 --> 01:19:08,342
[chains jangling]

813
01:19:10,945 --> 01:19:13,480
The Scorpion King.

814
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:33,368
[chattering, faint]

815
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:11,703
I've sedated him.

816
01:20:11,705 --> 01:20:16,175
This is the Scorpion King
everyone whispers about.

817
01:20:16,177 --> 01:20:18,446
Legends always start
with a whisper.

818
01:20:29,723 --> 01:20:34,126
Hmm. He doesn't look like
very much in these chains.

819
01:20:34,128 --> 01:20:36,231
Before I take his
head off his shoulders...

820
01:20:38,632 --> 01:20:40,435
let's see how he fights.

821
01:20:43,504 --> 01:20:45,403
Alert me when he wakes
from his slumber.

822
01:20:45,405 --> 01:20:47,706
Are you sure
this is wise?

823
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:49,444
Kill him now
and be done with it.

824
01:20:52,545 --> 01:20:54,712
He's already half dead,
Priestess.

825
01:20:54,714 --> 01:20:59,385
Half-dead men are dangerous,
especially a man like this.

826
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:03,692
The jackals want to see this
great warrior killed in battle.

827
01:21:05,258 --> 01:21:07,494
We must satiate
their bloodlust.

828
01:21:10,798 --> 01:21:13,702
He is weak and wounded...

829
01:21:16,704 --> 01:21:18,572
and no match for this sword!

830
01:21:29,749 --> 01:21:31,151
No!

831
01:21:37,191 --> 01:21:38,259
Princess Tala.

832
01:21:45,132 --> 01:21:46,468
I am your queen now.

833
01:21:50,404 --> 01:21:53,104
If called, are the men
ready to fight?

834
01:21:53,106 --> 01:21:54,676
The men will fight,
my queen.

835
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:02,280
What is this?

836
01:22:02,282 --> 01:22:04,352
The <i>Book of Souls.</i>

837
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:08,422
Written on ancient vellum...

838
01:22:09,789 --> 01:22:13,293
illuminated in the blue light
of the evening sun.

839
01:22:14,762 --> 01:22:16,197
Such beauty.

840
01:22:17,831 --> 01:22:20,666
So, you thought
to defeat me

841
01:22:20,668 --> 01:22:24,772
by destroying the sword,
and with it, my power?

842
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:38,186
I see you're a book with
a will of your own.

843
01:22:39,453 --> 01:22:42,757
Such contempt
in your eyes.

844
01:22:46,293 --> 01:22:47,695
Burn the bitch.

845
01:23:24,498 --> 01:23:25,834
[Tala] Rise, Blacksmith.

846
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:30,536
Become the Scorpion King again.

847
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:36,641
We honor the covenant between
the God of Underworld, Anubis,

848
01:23:36,643 --> 01:23:40,711
and the bearer of his sword,
our God-King Nebserek!

849
01:23:40,713 --> 01:23:43,649
[all chanting]
Nebserek! Nebserek! Nebserek!

850
01:23:43,651 --> 01:23:45,184
Nebserek! Nebserek!

851
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:47,853
[Priestess] Here,
on this sacred ground,

852
01:23:47,855 --> 01:23:52,757
we gather at the sacrificial
fires to put forth a ritual...

853
01:23:52,759 --> 01:23:57,397
Remember who you are,
Scorpion King: demigod,

854
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:59,467
the last Akkadian.

855
01:24:06,339 --> 01:24:10,744
[woman chanting
in foreign language]

856
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,788
[chanting stops]

857
01:24:44,911 --> 01:24:46,778
[grunting]

858
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:50,782
As written in the prophesies,
the <i>Book of Souls</i> shall burn

859
01:24:50,784 --> 01:24:51,920
and be thus destroyed.

860
01:24:52,986 --> 01:24:54,819
Let no man stand
against us!

861
01:24:54,821 --> 01:24:56,391
I am one man!

862
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:01,929
But one can stand
against many...

863
01:25:05,732 --> 01:25:06,700
for a friend.

864
01:25:10,437 --> 01:25:11,936
[yelling]

865
01:25:11,938 --> 01:25:14,374
[grunting]

866
01:25:16,643 --> 01:25:18,713
Calm your blades, Jackals.

867
01:25:21,315 --> 01:25:22,917
He's mine!

868
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,395
How was your sleep,
Scorpion King?

869
01:25:35,795 --> 01:25:36,931
I'm just a blacksmith.

870
01:25:38,464 --> 01:25:40,767
I admire a man
who stands tall.

871
01:25:41,634 --> 01:25:43,402
Even when he's overmatched.

872
01:25:43,404 --> 01:25:45,370
[crowd cheering]

873
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,380
[Nebserek] The time for
chanting has not yet come.

874
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,640
- Enkidu, it's time.
- [Nebserek] The people want...

875
01:25:49,642 --> 01:25:52,913
I did not protect Amina.
I failed her.

876
01:25:54,481 --> 01:25:56,470
We have not failed.

877
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:57,349
- [snarls]
- Not yet.

878
01:25:57,351 --> 01:25:58,649
[Nebserek]
He threatens my reign.

879
01:25:58,651 --> 01:25:59,853
[grunts]

880
01:26:01,821 --> 01:26:04,525
You stand
on the ruins of my people.

881
01:26:05,726 --> 01:26:09,528
Broken many years ago
by your Akkadian Empire.

882
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:13,532
We were forced
to live like jackals,

883
01:26:13,534 --> 01:26:14,969
eating scraps
to survive.

884
01:26:15,835 --> 01:26:17,571
But one jackal...

885
01:26:18,539 --> 01:26:20,738
was not prepared to slink away,

886
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:24,544
and grow old,
starving and defeated!

887
01:26:32,852 --> 01:26:35,487
[grunting]

888
01:26:35,489 --> 01:26:39,623
I dug deep,
deep into the sand

889
01:26:39,625 --> 01:26:43,494
and found the one thing
that can rebuild an empire.

890
01:26:43,496 --> 01:26:44,695
[zapping]

891
01:26:44,697 --> 01:26:47,599
Ruled by an eater of souls.

892
01:26:47,601 --> 01:26:50,836
With this sword,
I am invincible!

893
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:54,405
[crowd chanting]
Nebserek! Nebserek! Nebserek!

894
01:26:54,407 --> 01:26:56,643
You fear no man.

895
